# FinTech-Financial-Planner

This project aims to develop a comprehensive financial planning tool for the members of a credit union. The tool focuses on two main aspects: personal finance planning for emergencies and retirement planning. Utilizing Python, along with APIs such as Alpaca for fetching historical stock and bond data, and the MCForecastTools library for Monte Carlo simulations, this project provides insights into the financial health of credit union members and forecasts their portfolio performance over 30 years.
